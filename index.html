      <h1>Welcome, my name is Caleb</h1>
      <p>I'm currently a software developer student at Thinkful.</p>
        <p>I've been interested in coding for a while, and have just recentley started learning. I'm located in Henderson, NV.</p>

      <h2 >About Me</h2>
        <p>I've been interested in coding since I was about 10 years old, but I never had the means to learn or practice. After graduating highschool, I started working at a Mechanic shop that I loved at first, and it ended up being the worst time in my life. I moved to Florida with my brother in search of a passion that I could turn into my career. I had a much better time in Florida. There I realized just how interested I was in coding, but it would've been very difficult to start there. Here I am now in Nevade, having the best time of my life, and learning about a career I'm very passionate about at the same time.</p>

        <p>I have several interests outside of coding:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Rock climbing</li>
            <li>Painting</li>
            <li>Making Music</li>
            <li>Reading</li>
          </ul>
